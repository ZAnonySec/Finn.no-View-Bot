# Finn.no-View-Bot
Automated View Increase Tool for FINN.no Ads  (View Bot)


1 Clone the Repository:
First, you need to clone your GitHub repository to your local machine where you want to run the script. Open your command prompt and use the following command to clone the repository:

2 bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-repository with the name of your GitHub repository.

3 Install Dependencies:
Navigate into the directory where your script (finn_bot.py) is located and install the necessary dependencies. You'll need to install Selenium if you haven't already:

4 Copy code
pip install selenium
Ensure that ChromeDriver is also downloaded and placed in a location accessible from your PATH or specify its path in your script.

5 Running the Script
Once you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, follow these steps to run your Python script (finn_bot.py) from the command line:

6 Navigate to Script Directory:
Use the cd command to change directory to where your script is located. For example:

7 bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/repository
Replace path/to/your/repository with the actual path to the directory where finn_bot.py is located.

8 Run the Script:
Once you are in the correct directory, run the script using the Python interpreter:

9 Copy code
python finn_bot.py
This command assumes that your Python installation is correctly set up and Python is added to your system's PATH.

10 
The script will start running and will continuously open Chrome in incognito mode, visit the specified FINN.no ad URL, wait for a few seconds, close the browser, and repeat this process indefinitely.
You can monitor the script's execution in your command prompt. Any errors or messages will be displayed there.
Notes
Make sure you have replaced placeholders like '/path/to/chromedriver' with the actual path to your ChromeDriver executable and url with the specific FINN.no ad URL in your finn_bot.py script before running it.
Ensure that your system meets the requirements for running Selenium and ChromeDriver.
Running automated scripts like this should be done responsibly and in compliance with website terms of service to avoid any legal issues.
